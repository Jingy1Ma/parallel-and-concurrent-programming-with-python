    "In the previous example, the critical section for this program exists between the acquire methods on lines 14 and 15, and the release methods on lines 21 and 22. If one of the philosopher's threads acquires the locks, and when something goes wrong in that critical section to cause an unexpected error, that could kill its thread before it gets a chance to release the lock. To simulate happening, We'll add another `if` statement to check it there're exactly 10 pieces of sushi left and do my favorite technique for intentionally crashing a program - divide by 0. \n",
