If we press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open the Windows Task Manager and go to the performance tab, we will that the CPU is not overly busy (it's probably only at about 1%). Since the threads are stuck waiting on each other, the deadlock program doesn't use up CPU cycles. Now our program will be stuck in this state forever, so we need to manually terminate it. Running this program again, we will result in a deadlock after a different amount of sushi. The amount of progress it makes before the deadlock will vary depending on how the threads get scheduled to execute. If we're lucky, it's possible that the program could make it to the end of the 500 piece sushi plate. But luck is not a good strategy for programming.
